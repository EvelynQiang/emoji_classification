This repo includes source code used for EECS 595 course project Emoji Prediction in English Tweets.

For SVM, run the svm/k-fold-linear.py.

For BiLSTM, run BiLSTM/model/task2/train.py. Due to the limit, we didn't upload the pre-train file. Put the pre-train model into BiLSTM/embeddings. To run character-level embedding, change the token type in TASK2-A in BiLSTM/model/parameters.py to "char".
